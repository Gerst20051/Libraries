The JavaScript Browser Sniffer is able to identify these browsers:

    * Microsoft Internet Explorer (should work with any version)
    * Netscape 4.x, 6.x and 7.x
    * Mozilla Seamonkey, Galeon, Firebird, Phoenix, Epiphany, K-Meleon, Camino and Chimera (should work with any version)
    * Opera (should work with any version)
    * Konqueror (should work with any version)
    * Nautilus (version number is not available yet)
    * Safari (should work with any version)
    * Omniweb (should work with any version))
    * Links (should work with any version)
    * ELinks (should work with any version)
    * PowerMarks (should work with any version)
    * Crazy Browser (should work with any version)
    * MyIE2 (should work with any version)
    * Java (should work with any version)
    * iCab (should work with any version)
    * NetFront (should work with any version)
    * Avant Browser (should work with any version)
    * MSN Explorer (should work with any version)
    * w3m (should work with any version) (please note that w3m only supports JavaScript at client-side if using w3m-js)
    * Netcaptor (should work with any version)
    * Dillo (should work with any version) (only server-side)
    * Lynx (should work with any version) (only server-side)
    * Playstation 3 (should work with any version)

And these bots (only server-side, of course, because bots do not execute JavaScript):

    * wget (should work with any version)
    * GoogleBot
    * GoogleBot Images
    * MSNBot
    * TurnitinBot
    * Zyborg

It will also tell you which operating system you run, which browser engine are you using (gecko, khtml...), the full user agent string and which version of the Flash plug-in you have (in case you do have).

Since version 0.5, it works at client-side (no need to pass parameters, fully compatible with previous versions) or at server-side (you must pass the variable that contains the user agent string).

Since version 0.5.3, it detects popup blockers and Javascript version.

My current list of priorities:

   1. Detect Adobe SVG plug-in
   2. Identify Linux distribution

If you want me to add anything, just ask (paugq AT users DOT sourceforge DOT net)
